   which his neighbours, Stewart and Linda Shankland, said left their
   property in darkness and made their lives a misery (pictured bottom
   inset left and right). The Shanklands complained to council bosses
   after Mr Titi said he would not cut down the trees they alleged towered
   over their property at 33ft (main picture, an aerial view of the
   properties showing the trees). Mr Titi said the trees are popular in
   the upmarket village of Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, and claimed they
   provide a barrier between his £500,000 house and a railway line. The
   Shanklands used high hedge legislation to force Mr Titi to take action
   after mediation failed and the council approved their request and
   ordered a section be removed and others cut down to 12ft. Mr Titi
   appealed to the Scottish Government in a bid to save stop the axe
   falling but officials have now backed the council and ordered them to
   be lopped. But Mr Titi won a partial reprieve after a reporter set a
   maximum height of 15ft for sections of the hedge.

   Britain's behaviour every three months until then, with the threat of
   tearing up the extension if the EU thinks the UK is being disruptive.
