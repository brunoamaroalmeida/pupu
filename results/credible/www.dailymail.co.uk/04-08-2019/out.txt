   looks inevitable PM is forced to gear up for poll next month as long
   Government officials formally triggered the elections for May 23 - at
   an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £100 million - while the Tories
   launched a search for candidates. Only last month, the Prime Minister
   (main) said it would be 'unacceptable' to take part in the poll, almost
   three years after the vote to leave the EU. But an email to Tory
   candidates earlier this evening (inset) said: 'Due to the current
   situation we will be contesting the European Elections on 23 May 2019
   and the closing date for nominations is 24 April.' However, in a later
   email, (also inset) Tory chairman Brandon Lewis U-turned on the
   remarks, which were made by the party's head of candidates Gareth Fox.
   He suggested Mr Fox's email was only outlining what would happen if
   this ambition is not achieved. Mrs May will today travel to Berlin and
   Paris for talks as she tries to persuade EU leaders to agree to only a
   short extension of Article 50 - to June 30 - in order to avoid a No
   Deal Brexit on Friday. Bottom left is German chancellor Angela Merkel

   Police in California say Jacob Munn, 30, (left with his son) killed the
   27-year-old mother of his child, Brenda Renteria, (right) with a
   shotgun blast in front of the Hawthorne police headquarters. Renteria
   died at the scene. A relative of the victim, who witnessed the
   shooting, was seen breaking down crying in scene pictures (center) as
   she was comforted by an officer. Lt. Ti Goetz said an officer who heard
   shots from inside the station rushed outside, spotted Munn and opened
   fire. The couple's 17-month-old son was present at the shooting but was
   not physically hurt. He was reportedly inside the police station at the
   time. According to investigators, Renteria had gone to the police
   station on Hawthorne Boulevard to pick up her child from his father.
   While standing outside the lobby of the police headquarters, the
   parents began arguing. At some point during the exchange, Munn
   allegedly produced a shotgun and fired on Renteria, killing her just
   steps away from the front door of the police station. He then jumped
   back in his black Chevy pickup truck and sped off, police said.

   Footage in Sir David Attenborough's Netflix documentary Our Planet
   showed walruses plunging off 250ft high cliffs in northeast Russia
   (right). The animals were said to be making the dangerous climb to
   higher ground to escape receding sea ice due to warming seas. But a
   leading zoologist has accused filmmakers of using 'tragedy porn' and
   'emotional manipulation' to gain viewers. Susan Crockford, of the
   University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, claims the animals
   were more likely to have been driven over the cliffs after being chased
   by polar bears. She cited a famous incident in 2017 near where the
   Netflix series was filmed, where 20 polar bears chased walruses over to
   top of cliffs at Kozhevnikova Cape, Ryrkaypiy, in eastern Russia.

   daughter to suicide Father wins civil suit against dance cult leader
   Tibor Stern won a wrongful death lawsuit against Katsura Kan, a
   Japanese citizen who teaches Butoh, a dance in which students are told
   to 'wallow in the darkness of their soul'. Butoh features slow,
   controlled movements and is traditionally performed in white body
   makeup. Kan was found liable by a Florida circuit court in March after
   he failed to attend a summary judgment; Damages have yet to be
   determined. Sharon met Kan when she enrolled at Naropa University in
   Boulder, Colorado in 2007. Tibor claimed Kan 'seduced Sharon, abused
   her physically and mentally, humiliated her, insulted her, and
   manipulated her'. What kept Tibor going through this expensive,
   six-year battle was his desire for justice. He said: 'I'm a very loving
   father and she was my best friend. I know who she was. I know what she
   became. The man needed to be found guilty.' Pictured: Kan in Butoh's
   white body makeup (left), Kan with Sharon and other dancers in the body
   makeup (right) and Sharon and her father Tibor (center).
