[42]'Get them blind and then back to ours': Cricketer Alex Hepburn's vile
WhatsApp messages are revealed as he sobs at being found GUILTY of raping a
sleeping woman during sexual conquest 'game'
   [43]Cricketer Alex Hepburn, 23, is found GUILTY of raping a sleeping
   woman Cricketer Alex Hepburn, 23, is found GUILTY of raping a sleeping
   A former county cricketer who was found guilty of raping a woman during
   a 'sexual conquest competition' sent a series of vile messages to
   friends on Whatsapp, including one where he wrote: 'Always me dragging
   the birds back, you raping them' (pictured inset left).
   Ex-Worcestershire star Alex Hepburn (pictured with his girlfriend Lucy
   Street, middle and right) had denied two counts of rape relating to the
   incident in the early hours of April 1, 2017 at his flat in Worcester.
   He was convicted of one charge at Worcester Crown Court today, but was
   cleared of a second rape charge relating to the same victim. Hepburn
   (left) sighed and then slumped into his seat, covered his face with his
   hands and sobbed after the verdict was returned by the foreman.
   Prosecutors claimed he began to rape the woman while she was asleep
   after getting into her bed, where she had earlier had consensual sex
   with his then-teammate Joe Clarke. After his conviction, several
   sickening texts written by the 23-year-old came to light. In one
   message not heard by the jury, using what is thought to be a nickname,
   Hepburn boasted: 'Got to understand that Hepperdawg is a horny c*** and
   without you keeping my head straight just goes and does rogue things'.

   Wolf Comedy Club was being held on Thursday. Audience members were
   under the impression this was part of the act and continued to laugh at
   the supposed joke, with no one aware that Cognito was seriously ill.
   John Ostojak, who attended the show, told the BBC: 'Only 10 minutes
   before he sat down he joked about having a stroke. He said, 'imagine

   British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery devised the plan that called
   for a lighting-fast attack on nine bridges over the Rhine in the
   Netherlands, including one at Arnhem (inset) giving the Allies an
   invasion route into Germany. While the daring operation initially met
   with success (left and centre), it transpired the Allies had
   under-estimated the strength and effectiveness of the German defences
   (right). Within days the plan was badly behind schedule, sacrificing
   its key advantage. While the fighting did lead to the liberation of two
   Dutch towns and saw several key objectives captured, it ultimately
   failed to capture the bridge at Arnhem - dubeed a bridge too far. The
