   Charles Michel) as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting with EU leaders
   today preparing to impose a Brexit delay of up to a year upon Theresa
   May - despite her request it be limited to 30 June. The French
   President has been urged not to 'humiliate' the Prime Minister but is
   expected to reject her plea to push Brexit back by a few months and
   demand the UK stays until at least Christmas with a number of
   humiliating conditions attached. All 27 EU leaders must agree
   unanimously on the terms of the delay tonight. The Prime Minister is
   due to in Brussels this evening where EU leaders are expected ignore
   her request for a short Article 50 extension and force a delay to
   December 31 or even March 31, 2020. Macron is also calling for regular
   'behaviour reviews' of the UK and a 'Boris-proof' lock preventing a new
   Tory leader causing havoc within the EU if she stands down, despite
   warnings from Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel not to poison relations

   [149]Will Brexit ever happen? Will Brexit ever happen?
   Britain is set to be pushed into a year-long delay to Brexit tonight
   after Theresa May effectively axed the prospect of No Deal on Friday.
   The Prime Minister's hopes of a short extension that expires in June
   appear to be doomed as she prepares to fly to Brussels following PMQs
   today. Views among EU leaders vary - but the expiry of Article 50 looks
   likely to be shifted to at least the end of this year. Mrs May could
   get the option to break the extension early if her deal finally passes
   Parliament - but EU Council President Donald Tusk has gone public with
   warnings there is 'little reason' to believe it will ever happen.
   French President Emmanuel Macron has taken the most hardline stance,
   insisting Britain must be tied into strict rules to stop it misbehaving
   during any new delay. He is highly unlikely to actually veto the delay,
   however. At the last summit three weeks ago the EU leaders debated in
   private for almost six hours. A similar row this time would mean

   Scientists have lifted the veil on the first images ever captured of a
   black hole's event horizon. In a highly-anticipated string of press
   conferences held simultaneously around the world on Wednesday, the team
   behind the Event Horizon Telescope revealed the findings from their
   first run of observations. Using a 'virtual telescope' built from eight
   radio observatories positioned at different points on the globe, the
   international team has spent the last few years probing Sagittarius A*,
   the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, and another
   target in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. While black holes are
   invisible by nature, the ultra-hot material swirling in their midst is
   thought to form a ring of light around the perimeter that would reveal
   the mouth of the object itself based on its silhouette.

   Dan Robinson, 43, was left thunderstruck after watching the bolts blast
   upwards through the night sky, rather than streaking down as they
   usually do. The veteran photographer, who has been taking his camera
   into extreme weather since he was 16 to 'capture nature's dramatic
   side', filmed the extraordinary lightning strikes last month across
   Texas, Oklahoma and Illinois. And a two-minute compilation video of his
   footage has been released in slow motion - reduced to 1,500 frames per
   second - to show the stunning and uncommon lightning tree formations.

   longer than a BUS Sony has built a 63ft-wide 16K 'super resolution'
   Japanese electronics giant Sony are installing a 'super resolution'
   television screen (main) which is 63ft by 17ft (19.2m by 5.4m) at a
   research centre (inset) owned by Japanese cosmetics group Shiseido, in
   Yokohama. According to reports, the display offers '64 times' as many
   pixels as a regular 1080p high definition television.This means that it
   can show more images in far more detail than normal screens and viewers
   can stand close to it without them being blurred.
