[42]Police carry ranting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange out of the
Ecuadorian Embassy in London as he is ARRESTED following US extradition
request - seven years after he was given refuge
   [964x580_JPG-SINGLE_6419095511707305025.jpg]
   Julian Assange has been arrested by British police today after Ecuador
   dramatically withdrew his political asylum seven years after he was
   given refuge in the country's London embassy. The Wikileaks founder,
   sporting a scruffy beard and unkempt hair (left and top right), was
   dragged out of the building head-first in handcuffs by a group of seven
   men as stunned supporters watched on as he screamed out 'the UK must
   resist'. Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno said the decision to withdraw
   Assange's asylum status followed his 'discourteous and aggressive
   behaviour' in continuing to work with WikiLeaks while housed at the
   embassy. Assange, 47, has not left Ecuador's diplomatic soil since
   2012, when the country offered diplomatic protection from allegations
   of sexual assault in Sweden, a case which prosecutors revealed could
   now be reinvestigated following his surprise arrest. Assange has always
   feared extradition to the US, where his lawyers have claimed he could
   face the death penalty for the leaking of highly-classified documents.
   It was accidentally revealed last year that Assange had been secretly
   indicted by the US Justice Department on unknown charges.

   The Prime Minister is set to face a bruising in the Commons at

   Brexit at a crunch Brussels summit that ended at 2am today. European
   Council president Donald Tusk gave Mrs May a glimmer of hope that the
   UK could leave before October, saying the 'course of action is entirely
   in the UK's hands' - but urged them: 'Don't waste this time'. Mrs May
   had begged them to postpone Britain's departure until June 30 while she
   talks to Jeremy Corbyn - but this was rejected, leaving the PM in a
   precarious position having repeatedly said she could not 'countenance'
   Britain staying in the EU after that date.
